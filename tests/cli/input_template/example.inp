# In-place Active Comment Functionality
##
# This is an example of a data set where comments are marked by a '#' and
# pyslice looks for a '#$'.  The 'comment' and 'active_comment' strings are set
# in pyslice.ini
#

# Then the following template string will replace the block of 3 lines after with:
#  1.20000000 **** is equal to 120.400000

#$ {water_level:10.8f} **** is equal to {flow:10f}|3
 1.40000000 notc is equal to 220.400000
 6.20000000 mask is equal to 420.400000
 8.20000000 find is equal to 620.400000
# Note that the block of lines AFTER has been replaced with the results of
# processing the template line except for the mask part of the template marked
# by '*'s.
